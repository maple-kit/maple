# @maple-kit/mcp

The Model Context Protocol server that hands a coding agent the review comments
[Maple](https://github.com/maple-kit/maple) collected on a preview deployment.

**Pre-release.** Every package here is 0.x and makes no compatibility promise.

</p>

The agent waits for a comment, reads it with its context — `file:line` from
the tagger, the viewport, the screenshot, the mock it was written under — makes
the change, and resolves it against the commit that fixed it. The reviewer's
half is the overlay; the two meet in the store.

## Install

```sh
npm install @maple-kit/mcp
```

Two binaries ship: `maple-mcp`, the server, and `maple-stop-hook`, which stops
an agent from calling itself finished while comments are still open.

## Connect an agent

A client starts the server with no arguments, so it is configured through the
environment. In Claude Code's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maple": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "-p", "@maple-kit/mcp", "maple-mcp"],
      "env": { "MAPLE_GITHUB_OWNER": "acme", "MAPLE_GITHUB_REPO": "web" }
    }
  }
}
```

and run the client under `op run --env-file` so `GITHUB_TOKEN` never lands in a
file. A missing value fails at startup rather than on the first tool call.

| ------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`           | Yes    | A token that can read and write pull-request comments. Required for the `github` store.                              |
| `MAPLE_GITHUB_OWNER`     | No     | The repository's owner. Required for the `github` store.                                                             |
| `MAPLE_GITHUB_REPO`      | No     | The repository. Required for the `github` store.                                                                     |
| `MAPLE_GITHUB_API`       | No     | The API root, for Enterprise Server.                                                                                 |
| `MAPLE_STORE`            | No     | `github`, the default when a forge is configured, or `file`, the default when none is: the comments under `.maple/`. |
| `MAPLE_BRANCH`           | No     | The branch the Stop hook checks, else the one checked out. The server ignores it.                                    |
| `MAPLE_URL`              | No     | The deployed route's mount URL. A resolve asks it to republish the gate.                                             |
| `MAPLE_GATE_TOKEN`       | Yes    | For CI only: the gate App's installation token. Not with `MAPLE_URL`.                                                |
| `MAPLE_GATE_APP_ID`      | No     | The gate App's id, so it updates its own check run rather than another's.                                            |
| `MAPLE_REQUIRE_APPROVAL` | No     | `true` to hold the gate until somebody approves, matching the route and CI.                                          |

### With no forge

Set none of `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `MAPLE_GITHUB_OWNER` and `MAPLE_GITHUB_REPO` and the
server reads and writes the comments `fileStore()` keeps under `.maple/` in its
working directory's repository, so the loop works on a laptop with no pull
request. `MAPLE_STORE=file` says so explicitly. It is a laptop's store, not a
preview pod's: `docs/connectors.md` has the argument. The Stop hook still needs
a forge configured and stays silent without one.

| ------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `list_comments(branch, statuses?)`               | ✓     | Return the review comments on a branch, newest first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `wait_for_comments(branch, cursor?, timeoutMs?)` | ✓     | Block until a new comment arrives or the wait elapses. Returns status "timeout" rather than failing when nothing arrives.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `resolve_comment(id, sha, note?)`                |       | Mark a comment resolved, recording the commit that addressed it.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `get_comment_context(id, branch)`                | ✓     | Return everything needed to act on one comment: anchor, viewport, surrounding markup and any replay link. A comment written under a Maple Mock carries `mock.recipe` and `mock.replay`, a link to the page in that state.                                                      |
| `start_solo(previewUrl)`                         |       | Start a bridge on localhost and return the link that pairs a deployed preview with it. The reviewer opens the link in their browser and the comments they write there land in .maple/ for list_comments and wait_for_comments to read. They never count toward the merge gate. |

<!-- /generated:mcp-tools -->

`wait_for_comments` is clamped to 55 seconds because every coding client cuts a
tool call off at 60, and it emits `notifications/progress` every 15 seconds. A
timeout is a result: an agent that treats one as an error stops looping the
first time nobody is looking. Its cursor is a timestamp; omit it on the first
call to drain whatever is already waiting.

## The Stop hook

MCP gives a server no way to interrupt a client, so the loop is closed from the
other end. Claude Code's `Stop` hook runs when the agent believes it is
finished, and Maple's answers with the comments still open:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "npx -y -p @maple-kit/mcp maple-stop-hook" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

The Maple Claude Code plugin registers it for you. It blocks while a comment
is `open` or `needs_reverify`, at most eight stops in a row per session; on the
ninth it lets the session end and says what is still open, which beats an agent
resolving comments to escape. The count is kept per `session_id` in the system
temp directory, and a stop no block caused starts it again.

**The hook does not see `.mcp.json`'s `env`.** That block is handed to the MCP
server alone; a hook runs in the client's own environment. So
`MAPLE_GITHUB_OWNER`, `MAPLE_GITHUB_REPO` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` have to be set
where the client itself starts — under the same `op run --env-file` — or the
hook fails naming the one missing. With neither of the first two set, it lets
every stop through. `MAPLE_BRANCH` defaults to the branch checked out in the
session's working directory.

## Resolving clears the gate

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maple-kit/maple/main/docs/assets/features/merge-gate.gif" alt="A pull request's checks: maple/visual-review fails with two comments open, they resolve, the check passes and the merge button wakes up." width="480">
</p>

With `MAPLE_URL` set to a deployed route's mount URL, such as
`https://web-482.preview.acme.dev/api/maple`, `resolve_comment` asks that route
to republish `maple/visual-review`, so an agent that resolves the last comment
with nothing left to push does not leave the check holding on finished work.
The request carries the branch and `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which must be able to push
to the repository. The route decides the verdict and publishes with the gate
App's own credentials, which never leave it. A failed refresh is logged to
stderr and the resolve is still recorded.

`MAPLE_GATE_TOKEN` is the other way, for CI: a gate App installation token the
server publishes with directly. It expires an hour after it is minted, so it
suits a job, not a session. Setting both fails at startup.
