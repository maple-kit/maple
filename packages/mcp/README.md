# @maple-kit/mcp

The Model Context Protocol server that hands a coding agent the review comments
[Maple](https://github.com/maple-kit/maple) collected on a preview deployment.

**Pre-release.** Every package here is 0.x and makes no compatibility promise.

</p>

The agent waits for a comment, reads it with its context — `file:line` from
the tagger, the viewport, the screenshot, the mock it was written under — makes
the change, and resolves it against the commit that fixed it. The reviewer's
half is the overlay; the two meet in the store.

## Install

```sh
npm install @maple-kit/mcp
```

Two binaries ship: `maple-mcp`, the server, and `maple-stop-hook`, which stops
an agent from calling itself finished while comments are still open.

## Connect an agent

A client starts the server with no arguments, so it is configured through the
environment. In Claude Code's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maple": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "-p", "@maple-kit/mcp", "maple-mcp"],
      "env": { "MAPLE_GITHUB_OWNER": "acme", "MAPLE_GITHUB_REPO": "web" }
    }
  }
}
```

and run the client under `op run --env-file` so `GITHUB_TOKEN` never lands in a
file. A missing value fails at startup rather than on the first tool call.

| Variable                                  | What it is                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `MAPLE_GITHUB_OWNER`, `MAPLE_GITHUB_REPO` | The repository.                                                    |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`                            | Server-side only. Never in a file.                                 |
| `MAPLE_STORE`                             | `github`, the default and so far the only one.                     |
| `MAPLE_GITHUB_API`                        | For GitHub Enterprise Server.                                      |
| `MAPLE_BRANCH`                            | The branch under review. Read by the Stop hook.                    |
| `MAPLE_GATE_TOKEN`, `MAPLE_GATE_APP_ID`   | The gate App's own token and id, so a resolve updates the gate.    |
| `MAPLE_REQUIRE_APPROVAL`                  | `true` where the gate is held until somebody approves the preview. |

## Tools

| Tool                                 | What it does                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_comments`                      | Every open comment on the branch, newest first.                                                                             |
| `wait_for_comments(cursor, timeout)` | Blocks for up to 55s, then returns `timeout` rather than an error.                                                          |
| `get_comment_context(id)`            | The anchor, the viewport and what the reviewer was looking at, and the mock they wrote it under with a link that replays it |
| `resolve_comment(id, sha, note)`     | Closes a thread against the commit that closed it, and publishes the gate's verdict.                                        |

`wait_for_comments` is clamped to 55 seconds because every coding client cuts a
tool call off at 60, and it emits `notifications/progress` every 15 seconds. A
timeout is a result: an agent that treats one as an error stops looping the
first time nobody is looking. Its cursor is a timestamp; omit it on the first
call to drain whatever is already waiting.

## The Stop hook

MCP gives a server no way to interrupt a client, so the loop is closed from the
other end. Claude Code's `Stop` hook runs when the agent believes it is
finished, and Maple's answers with the comments still open:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "npx -y -p @maple-kit/mcp maple-stop-hook" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

It blocks at most eight times. On the ninth it lets the session end and says
what is still open, which beats an agent resolving comments to escape.

## Resolving clears the gate

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maple-kit/maple/main/docs/assets/features/merge-gate.gif" alt="A pull request's checks: maple/visual-review fails with two comments open, they resolve, the check passes and the merge button wakes up." width="480">
</p>

With `MAPLE_GATE_TOKEN` set, `resolve_comment` publishes `maple/visual-review`
the way the overlay does, so an agent that resolves the last comment with
nothing left to push does not leave the check holding on finished work.
