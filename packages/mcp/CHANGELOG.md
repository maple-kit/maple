## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- d7a18bb: The npm page of every package now links https://maple-kit.org as its homepage. The repository link still opens the package's own folder.
- 913dc63: The package names its MCP Registry entry, `io.github.maple-kit/maple`, so the registry can verify that the server listed there is this package.

  - @maple-kit/core@0.17.1

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- d98f72b: `maple-stop-hook` reads the local store when no forge is configured: with neither `MAPLE_GITHUB_OWNER` nor `MAPLE_GITHUB_REPO` set it blocks on the open comments under `.maple/` for the checked-out branch, as it does for GitHub, so the agent loop works on a laptop with no pull request. It still lets every stop through where there is no `.maple/` folder, no comments for the branch or no git repository, and never creates the folder. A `MAPLE_STORE=github` with no repository named is still a no-op. Minor rather than patch: a hook that stayed silent in a project with `.maple/` comments now blocks there.

### Patch Changes

- @maple-kit/core@0.17.0

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 191b4ab: The server reads and resolves comments from `.maple/` when no forge is configured. `MAPLE_STORE` now accepts `file` as well as `github`; unset, it is `github` when any of `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `MAPLE_GITHUB_OWNER` or `MAPLE_GITHUB_REPO` is set and `file` when none is, so an agent on a laptop works with no pull request.

  Breaking: a server started with none of those variables used to exit at startup naming the missing one, and now starts on the local store instead. `storeFromEnvironment` takes an optional second argument, the directory whose repository names the folder.

- 6e998d1: Solo mode: a guest on a preview who cannot sign in can keep their comments on the machine that runs their agent. `maple solo <preview-url>` (and the new MCP tool `start_solo`) starts a bridge on `127.0.0.1` in front of the file store and prints `<preview-url>#maple-solo=<token>&maple-bridge=<address>`. The overlay reads the fragment as its script runs, removes it with `history.replaceState`, keeps the pairing in `localStorage` under the same guard as drafts, and posts comments and screenshots to the bridge as real comments in `.maple/<branch>/`. The bridge serves only requests that carry the token, from the paired origin, addressed to a loopback name. An unpaired overlay never requests localhost and shows one line offering `maple solo`. `docs/solo.md` has the design, including why solo cannot gate a merge.

  New: `startBridge` and `refusalFor` in `@maple-kit/core/local`; `capturePairing`, `forgetPairing`, `parsePairing`, `soloLink` in `@maple-kit/core/client`; `MapleClient.endSolo()` and `ClientState.solo`; `SoloOffer` in `@maple-kit/ui/island`; `start_solo` in `@maple-kit/mcp`.

  Breaking: `ClientState` has a new required `solo` field, and `MapleClient` a new required `endSolo` method, for anyone who implements either.

### Patch Changes

- 94880d9: Add `maple review`: the overlay on a running app with nothing wired into it. It runs the app's `dev` script with the package manager its lockfile names (or attaches with `--port` or `--url`) and opens a local reverse proxy that injects the overlay into HTML, serves the SDK route itself and passes WebSockets through, so HMR keeps working. The page's Content-Security-Policy is relaxed only as far as the overlay needs (`script-src-elem`, `connect-src`, `img-src blob:`), reusing the page's nonce, and only on the proxied response. It stands down when the page already mounts Maple. With no store configured, comments go to the local file store under `.maple/<branch>/`; `MAPLE_STORE` and the forge variables choose otherwise, as for the MCP server. There is no `maple use` yet.

  `@maple-kit/cli` now depends on `@maple-kit/ui`, which builds the overlay as one script (`dist/standalone.iife.js`, React bundled in). `CommentAnchor` gains an optional `locatedBy` (`tagger` or `owner-stack`), and `@maple-kit/core/anchor` gains `installSourceLocator`, `createSourceLocator` and `locateSource`, which find the file and line of an element on an untagged page from React 19's owner stack and the dev server's source map. `resolveLocalPlace` also returns the branch it keyed by. The MCP context marks an owner-stack location as one to check.

  Nothing that existed changed.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 92158b6: A region now anchors to the elements it covers, not only to the box it was measured in. A rectangle drawn over a card used to be stored as fractions of the smallest element that held all of it, and when that was the page shell the rectangle drifted whenever the page's height changed.

  `CommentAnchor` gains an optional `members` (`RegionMember[]`: an anchor, pixel offsets and overlap per element, at most four, tagged elements first). `resolveAnchor` resolves each member through the normal cascade and returns them on `Resolved.members`; a partly found or spread-out region is drawn from the members that resolved at lowered confidence, and with none found it uses the container fractions as before. Anchors stored without `members` resolve as they did.

  New exports from `@maple-kit/core/anchor`: `captureMembers`, `membersBox`, `nameMembers`, `MAXIMUM_MEMBERS`, `MINIMUM_OVERLAP`. The ring, the markdown export, the gate's open-comment list, the Stop hook and `get_comment_context` name a region by its members ("BrewGuideCard +1"). `TargetRing` takes a `members` prop, and `Located` carries `members`.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- d1923ff: `maple-mcp` reads `MAPLE_URL`, the deployed route's mount URL. With it set, `resolve_comment` asks the route's `POST /gate/refresh` to republish `maple/visual-review`, sending the branch and `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and holds no gate credential at all. This replaces `MAPLE_GATE_TOKEN` on a developer machine, where the static installation token stopped working an hour into a session. `MAPLE_GATE_TOKEN` stays for CI, and setting both now fails at startup. A failed refresh is logged to stderr and the resolve is still recorded.

### Patch Changes

- e021a48: The `branch` argument of the MCP tools is described as the pull request's head branch. It used to say "branch or pull request", but a pull request number never resolved and returned no comments.

  - @maple-kit/core@0.14.0

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- fdb20e3: `maple-stop-hook` now gives up after eight blocked stops in a row under Claude Code. It used to count a `blocks` field Claude Code never sends, so it blocked for as long as a comment stayed open. The count is now kept per `session_id` in the system temp directory and starts again on any stop that `stop_hook_active` says no block caused.

  The hook also defaults `MAPLE_BRANCH` to the branch checked out in the session's working directory, and lets every stop through when neither `MAPLE_GITHUB_OWNER` nor `MAPLE_GITHUB_REPO` is set, so it can ship in the Claude Code plugin without failing in projects Maple does not review.

  Breaking: `decideStop(open, blocks)` takes the number of blocks so far instead of a `StopHookInput`, and `StopHookInput` now describes Claude Code's real Stop payload (`session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `hook_event_name`, `stop_hook_active`, …) without `blocks`. `decideSessionStop`, `fileBlockCounter`, `parseStopHookPayload` and `currentBranch` are new exports.

### Patch Changes

- a5e0af6: `maple-mcp` now reports a failed gate publish on resolve. It had no logger, so
  an expired `MAPLE_GATE_TOKEN` or a missing `checks: write` left the check on its
  old verdict with nothing said. It logs to stderr, since stdout is the MCP
  transport.

  Core adds `streamSink(stream)` to `@maple-kit/core/logger`: one text line per
  record to any `{ write(text) }`, such as `process.stderr`. `consoleSink` could
  not serve here because `console.info` writes to stdout.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 1cb2f6f: `get_comment_context` returns `mock: { recipe, replay }` for a comment written
  under a Maple Mock, where `replay` opens the comment's page with the recipe on,
  and adds a `mocked: …` line to `conditions`.
- 264e019: A recipe gains two layers beside `calls`: `flags`, flag keys answered with any
  JSON value, and `as`, who the page is told the reviewer is (a `role`, and
  `permissions` granted or taken away, both in the host's own words).
  `describeIdentity` says an identity in words. The ledger row reads
  `mocked as <identity>`, and `get_comment_context` names the flags and the
  identity and says the server acted as the reviewer.

  **Breaking:** `RECIPE_VERSION` is 2 and every recipe is written as version 2,
  so a build released before it refuses a new link or fence recipe rather than
  applying half of it. Version 1 is still read, and comes back as version 2.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 999dfb6: **Breaking:** `CommentStore` covers all nine `StoreConnector` methods, and the
  route and the MCP server now take one instead of a raw connector.

  `createCommentStore` wrapped three of nine methods and nothing inside Maple
  called it: the SDK route held a raw `StoreConnector` and so did the MCP server,
  so the retry, timeout and `MapleStoreError` layer reached one external caller
  and nothing a reviewer touched. The preview route now has retries.

  What changed for a host:

  - **`RouteOptions.store` takes a `CommentStore`**, as does a `StoreResolver`'s
    return. Wrap the connector: `store: createCommentStore(githubStore({ … }))`,
    or inside the resolver where the store is built per reviewer. A connector
    missing `list` or `append` now fails at construction rather than on the first
    request.
  - **`GateContext.store`** — what `publishGate` takes — and the MCP server's
    `HandlerOptions.store` take a `CommentStore` for the same reason.
  - **`CommentStore` gained `appendMany`, `head`, `watch`, `approvals`,
    `approve` and `unapprove`**, and `setStatus` gained the `resolution`
    argument the connector has taken since 0.5. A capability the connector lacks
    resolves to an absent value — `undefined` for the three reads, `null` for
    `approve`, `false` for `unapprove` — never to an empty one, because
    `decideGate` reads an empty approvals list as "nobody approved" and would
    block for ever on a store that keeps none. `capabilities` reports what the
    connector can do; the return value reports what happened.
  - **A store failure is no longer always a 400.** The route answers `503` when
    the store could not be reached and keeps `400` for a store that refused.
  - **A `RangeError` from a connector is no longer retried**, so a bad cursor or
    a negative limit is refused once rather than three times.

  Nothing changed about what a store connector writes or reads, so a published
  ledger stays readable by every version that could read it before.

  `docs/connectors.md` has the table the wrapper is kept complete against.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [999dfb6]
  - @maple-kit/core@0.8.0

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 24adb84: The gate hears about a resolve whoever did it, and `needs_reverify` is reachable.

  `resolve_comment` wrote the status and stopped. The route has published a
  verdict after a resolve since 0.6.0 — a reviewer who clears the last comment
  should not wait for a commit nobody needs to make — and the agent, doing the
  same thing through a different door, did not. An agent that resolved the last
  comment and had nothing left to push left `maple/visual-review` holding on work
  that was done.

  `publishGate` therefore moves from `src/route/gate.ts` to `@maple-kit/core/gate`
  beside the decision, and the MCP server takes an optional `gate` built from
  `MAPLE_GATE_TOKEN`. Without it nothing publishes and the behaviour is what it
  was.

  `decideGate` also gains `reverifyResolved`, which is what makes `needs_reverify`
  reachable at all: nothing in the repository ever wrote that status, so a gate
  that listed it among `BLOCKING_STATUSES` was blocking on a state that could not
  occur. On, a comment resolved against a commit that is no longer the head needs
  another look. Off by default.

  `docs/gate.md` now also states plainly that **nothing writes `orphaned` either**,
  and why the page cannot simply report it.

### Minor Changes

- 09cbbbd: Implement the MCP server behind the tool contract, and add the Stop hook.

  `maple-mcp` serves `list_comments`, `wait_for_comments`, `resolve_comment` and
  `get_comment_context` over stdio. The wait is clamped to 55 seconds, under
  every client's ceiling, and a timeout comes back as a result rather than an
  error.

  `maple-stop-hook` keeps an agent from finishing while comments are open, and
  gives up after eight attempts rather than hanging the session.

- 3b2edc2: Keep the commit that resolved a comment, instead of returning it and losing it.

  `Comment.resolution` is a `CommentResolution` — the `sha` an agent says
  addressed the comment, an optional `note`, and the `at` it was written. It rides
  through the export fence like every other field, so the default GitHub store
  persists it without a line of storage code.

  `setStatus` takes it as an optional third argument and stays capability-by-
  presence: a store that cannot keep a resolution still records the status.
  `resolve_comment` now passes the `sha` and `note` it has always accepted, and
  the route reads a resolution off the `PATCH` body but stamps `at` itself — a
  client that can date its own resolution can backdate one.

  A comment cannot arrive already resolved, so the route drops a `resolution`
  posted with a new comment, and the shared store contract asserts a resolution
  survives a re-read.

### Patch Changes

- 417376e: Every package publishes its licence, its notice and a readme. `files` was
  `["dist"]` and the three texts lived only at the repository root, so the
  artifact met none of Apache-2.0's redistribution terms and every npm page would
  have been blank.

  `@maple-kit/core` no longer carries a private copy of vitest. `/testing` imports
  `describe`, `it` and `expect` for the shared connector contract suite, and with
  vitest undeclared the build wrote it — and chai, expect-type, magic-string and
  tinybench — into `dist/node_modules/`, about half the tarball. Worse than the
  size: the suite registered its tests against that copy rather than the runner
  the consumer invoked, so it collected nothing. vitest is an optional peer
  dependency now, and running the contract suite means running it in your vitest.

- 567b444: Ship the docs in the type declarations and not in the JavaScript.

  Prose was about 46% of `@maple-kit/ui`'s gzipped weight, which is weight every
  application downloads to read something no runtime looks at. Every package's
  build now drops JSDoc from the emitted JavaScript and keeps it in the `.d.ts`,
  which is what an editor reads anyway.

  Two kinds of comment are kept deliberately. `@__PURE__` and
  `@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__` stay, because dropping them would silently cost
  tree-shaking. Legal notices stay, and the two ported files in
  `packages/core/src/lib/` are now marked `@preserve` so their BSD-2-Clause and
  MIT attributions reach the published build, which those licences require.
