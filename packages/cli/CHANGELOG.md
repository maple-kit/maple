# @maple-kit/cli

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 94880d9: Add `maple review`: the overlay on a running app with nothing wired into it. It runs the app's `dev` script with the package manager its lockfile names (or attaches with `--port` or `--url`) and opens a local reverse proxy that injects the overlay into HTML, serves the SDK route itself and passes WebSockets through, so HMR keeps working. The page's Content-Security-Policy is relaxed only as far as the overlay needs (`script-src-elem`, `connect-src`, `img-src blob:`), reusing the page's nonce, and only on the proxied response. It stands down when the page already mounts Maple. With no store configured, comments go to the local file store under `.maple/<branch>/`; `MAPLE_STORE` and the forge variables choose otherwise, as for the MCP server. There is no `maple use` yet.

  `@maple-kit/cli` now depends on `@maple-kit/ui`, which builds the overlay as one script (`dist/standalone.iife.js`, React bundled in). `CommentAnchor` gains an optional `locatedBy` (`tagger` or `owner-stack`), and `@maple-kit/core/anchor` gains `installSourceLocator`, `createSourceLocator` and `locateSource`, which find the file and line of an element on an untagged page from React 19's owner stack and the dev server's source map. `resolveLocalPlace` also returns the branch it keyed by. The MCP context marks an owner-stack location as one to check.

  Nothing that existed changed.

- 6e998d1: Solo mode: a guest on a preview who cannot sign in can keep their comments on the machine that runs their agent. `maple solo <preview-url>` (and the new MCP tool `start_solo`) starts a bridge on `127.0.0.1` in front of the file store and prints `<preview-url>#maple-solo=<token>&maple-bridge=<address>`. The overlay reads the fragment as its script runs, removes it with `history.replaceState`, keeps the pairing in `localStorage` under the same guard as drafts, and posts comments and screenshots to the bridge as real comments in `.maple/<branch>/`. The bridge serves only requests that carry the token, from the paired origin, addressed to a loopback name. An unpaired overlay never requests localhost and shows one line offering `maple solo`. `docs/solo.md` has the design, including why solo cannot gate a merge.

  New: `startBridge` and `refusalFor` in `@maple-kit/core/local`; `capturePairing`, `forgetPairing`, `parsePairing`, `soloLink` in `@maple-kit/core/client`; `MapleClient.endSolo()` and `ClientState.solo`; `SoloOffer` in `@maple-kit/ui/island`; `start_solo` in `@maple-kit/mcp`.

  Breaking: `ClientState` has a new required `solo` field, and `MapleClient` a new required `endSolo` method, for anyone who implements either.

### Minor Changes

- 4d32330: Every command now accepts `--flag value` as well as `--flag=value`, so `maple setup app --owner acme` works as typed. Arguments are parsed by `node:util`'s `parseArgs` against a flag list each command declares, strictly.

  What broke:

  - An unknown flag, a string flag with no value, or a value given to a boolean flag is now an error, exit 1, that names the command's valid flags. Before, a typo was silently ignored.
  - `--json=false` and the like no longer switch a boolean flag off; leave the flag out instead.
  - `parseArgs(argv)` is now `parseArgs(argv, spec, { strict })`, taking the flags to accept, and throws `ArgsError` when strict. `isSet` is true only for a boolean flag that was given. `ArgsError`, `describeFlags`, `GLOBAL_FLAGS` and the `FlagSpec` and `FlagType` types are new exports.

### Minor Changes

- 72ae851: `maple setup` registers and wires Maple's GitHub Apps from the command line.
  `setup app --owner=<org>` prints the prefilled New GitHub App URL — the comment
  App with `pull_requests: write` alone, or the gate App with `checks: write`
  alone under `--gate` — followed by the steps a URL cannot set. `setup verify
--client-id=<Iv…>` checks that Device Flow is on. `setup ci` prints, or with
  `--write` writes, the `maple-action` gate workflow and the `gh api` ruleset
  command that requires `maple/visual-review`. Both permission sets are exported
  as `GITHUB_APP_PERMISSIONS`.

### Minor Changes

- 5d832df: `maple mock plan "<sentence>" --url --route --calls` prints the recipe a
  preview's Maple route plans for a sentence, as the mock box's first chip would
  apply it, and exits 1 saying why when there is nothing to apply. It asks the
  route, so CI holds no model key. `maple mock` alone prints both subcommands'
  usage.
- 4b8e7c9: `maple mock schema <router.ts> [--export] [--out] [--superjson]` writes an
  OpenAPI document of a tRPC router's response types for Maple's route to serve
  as each call's shape, marked `x-maple-mock` so the route reads it untold. It
  wraps `@trpc/openapi@11.19.0-alpha`, an optional peer loaded only by this
  command.

  **Breaking:** `run()` returns a Promise.

### Patch Changes

- decec98: A mock plan sets flags and who the page is shown as. `MockPlanRequest` takes
  the page's `flags` (`{ key, type, variants? }`) and the host's `roles`, and
  `MockPlan` answers one `PlannedFlag` per flag and a `PlannedRole`. The route
  adds the roles from its own identity rules, drops a flag with no values, and
  keeps an answer to what was listed. `readPlan` carries named flags and a role
  on each suggestion, or as a suggestion of their own. The keyword planner reads
  them without ever taking a key from the sentence, `jevClassifier` asks for them
  in a second request so the state and calls are judged as before, the box sends
  the flags it saw and applies a layered chip, and `maple mock plan` prints them.
  `plannedFlag` and `flagValues` are exported from `@maple-kit/core/connectors`,
  and `memoryClassifier` takes `planFlags` and `planRole`.

  **Breaking:** `MockSuggestion.state` is optional, since a chip may name only a
  flag or a role, and `createMockPlanner` takes the route's mock schemas rather
  than a shapes lookup.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 64eabf6: A sixth connector kind: `ClassifierConnector`, for judging a comment as it is
  written.

  `score` and `classify` are both optional, so a backend that can only do one is
  used for that one, and `pillars` declares what it scores against. A score
  carries its distribution across the pillar's levels and a confidence, not just
  a level — a judgement that landed between two rungs has to be able to say so,
  or a surface renders a guess as a fact.

  `keywordClassifier()` is the zero-configuration tier: no network, no model, no
  options. It is what the feature does with the model tier switched off and the
  floor every eval measures against. `runClassifierContract` and
  `memoryClassifier` ship from `@maple-kit/core/testing`.

  **Breaking:** `ConnectorKind` gains `"classifier"`, so an exhaustive `switch`
  or a `Record<ConnectorKind, …>` over it no longer compiles until the new member
  is handled. `CONNECTOR_METHODS` and `REQUIRED_METHODS` gain a row each;
  `REQUIRED_METHODS.classifier` is empty, because a classifier that implements
  neither method is inert rather than invalid.

  `maple connectors` prints the sixth kind, and a kind that requires nothing now
  prints `required: none` rather than a blank the reader has to interpret.

  `docs/assist.md` is the design record — what a score is, and what it never is.

### Patch Changes

- 417376e: Every package publishes its licence, its notice and a readme. `files` was
  `["dist"]` and the three texts lived only at the repository root, so the
  artifact met none of Apache-2.0's redistribution terms and every npm page would
  have been blank.

  `@maple-kit/core` no longer carries a private copy of vitest. `/testing` imports
  `describe`, `it` and `expect` for the shared connector contract suite, and with
  vitest undeclared the build wrote it — and chai, expect-type, magic-string and
  tinybench — into `dist/node_modules/`, about half the tarball. Worse than the
  size: the suite registered its tests against that copy rather than the runner
  the consumer invoked, so it collected nothing. vitest is an optional peer
  dependency now, and running the contract suite means running it in your vitest.

- 567b444: Ship the docs in the type declarations and not in the JavaScript.

  Prose was about 46% of `@maple-kit/ui`'s gzipped weight, which is weight every
  application downloads to read something no runtime looks at. Every package's
  build now drops JSDoc from the emitted JavaScript and keeps it in the `.d.ts`,
  which is what an editor reads anyway.

  Two kinds of comment are kept deliberately. `@__PURE__` and
  `@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__` stay, because dropping them would silently cost
  tree-shaking. Legal notices stay, and the two ported files in
  `packages/core/src/lib/` are now marked `@preserve` so their BSD-2-Clause and
  MIT attributions reach the published build, which those licences require.
