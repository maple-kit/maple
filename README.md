A reviewer points at something on a preview deployment and says what is wrong.
Maple captures where they pointed, what they were looking at and who they are,
hands it to a coding agent in a form it can act on, and holds the merge until
every comment is resolved.

**Status: 0.x.** All eight packages are published, with provenance, through a
trusted publisher. 0.x makes no compatibility promise: a public interface is
broken when breaking it is the right shape, and the changeset says what broke.

## What it does

Each package's README shows the rest: [the CLI](packages/cli), [the design
lint](packages/lint), [flags and roles in a mock](packages/mock#flags-and-roles)
and [the connectors](packages/core#connectors).

## Why another one

Pincushion, Vercel Toolbar, Chromatic, BugHerd and Marker.io each do some of
this. None combines all four of:

- **Open source**, Apache-2.0, with no hosted service required.
- **Deployed previews.** Maple runs on the preview URL your CI already builds,
  so anyone with the link can comment — a designer, a product manager, a client.
  Tools like Agentation run against `localhost`, which means the only person who
  can leave a comment is the person running the build.
- **A merge gate** — CI blocks while a visual comment is unresolved, and
  optionally until somebody says they looked. See [`docs/gate.md`](docs/gate.md).
- **An agent loop** — the agent reads comments, fixes, and resolves them.

## Add it to an app

```sh
npm install @maple-kit/core @maple-kit/ui
```

Mount the route and the tagger from the build, then render the overlay:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { createCommentStore } from "@maple-kit/core";
import { githubStore } from "@maple-kit/core/connectors";
import { maple } from "@maple-kit/core/vite";

const preview = process.env.MAPLE_PREVIEW === "1";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    maple({
      tagger: preview,
      route: {
        store: createCommentStore(
          githubStore({ owner: "acme", repo: "web", token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN! }),
        ),
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

```tsx
// main.tsx
import { Maple } from "@maple-kit/ui/maple";

createRoot(root).render(
  <>
    <App />
    <Maple branch={import.meta.env.VITE_MAPLE_BRANCH} />
  </>,
);
```

Next.js uses `withMaple` from `@maple-kit/core/next` and a catch-all route at
`app/api/maple/[...maple]/route.ts`; [`examples/next-app`](examples/next-app)
has both. The `setup-maple-org` skill walks through the GitHub App a reviewer
signs in with.

## Vendor-agnostic by construction

Maple stores nothing itself. A connector is one file implementing plain
Promise-returning methods:

```ts
import type { StoreConnector } from "@maple-kit/core/connectors";

export function myStore(options: MyOptions): StoreConnector {
  return {
    name: "my-store",
    async list(query) {
      /* … */
    },
    async append(comment) {
      /* … */
    },
  };
}
```

There are six kinds — store, media, observability, identity, gate and
classifier — and a connector's capabilities are exactly the methods it defines.
Run `maple connectors` to print the matrix from the code, or see
[`docs/connectors.md`](docs/connectors.md).

## See it running

```
nvm use
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @maple-kit/example-vite dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

A real Vite application with three comments already on it: marks on the page,
the island in the corner, and all three picks working against an SDK route the
dev server mounts. [`examples/vite-app`](examples/vite-app) says what it does
and does not prove.

## Development

```
nvm use          # or fnm use, mise install — .nvmrc pins the version
pnpm install
pnpm hooks
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test
```

Requires Node 24, the active LTS, and pnpm 10. Switch **before** the install:
pnpm 10 and 11 load `node:sqlite`, which Node 23 does not have, so on the wrong
version pnpm crashes rather than telling you the version is wrong. See
